Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are a group of conditions that affect the digestive tract, from the esophagus to the intestines. Common symptoms include abdominal pain, bloating, gas, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, acid reflux, and changes in bowel habits. These signs might seem minor at first, but persistent issues could indicate more serious problems like ulcers, Crohn’s disease, or even gastrointestinal cancers. Early diagnosis is key to successful treatment. GI disorders are usually diagnosed through endoscopy, colonoscopy, blood tests, and imaging like ultrasound or CT scans. Treatment depends on the specific condition but may include dietary changes, medications (like antacids, antibiotics, or anti-inflammatory drugs), and in some cases, surgery. At Care and Cure Hospital, specialists provide personalized evaluation and advanced GI care to help you recover and manage long-term health.
